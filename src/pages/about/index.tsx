          The DataLink DAO will monetize anonymous data-sharing, and provide a
          powerful tokenization platform for credentials, documents, and other
          data. Our system will incentivize the validated data the user is
          receiving via smart contracts and oracle networks. Our services will
          give ownership of personal data back to the user while retaining the
          integrity of that data.
